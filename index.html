                <h1>Mission</h1>
                <p>A mission statement is all about the current active plans of the organization that defines goals. In
                    other words, it states the purpose of the organization and the reason it has existed. Also, it
                    represents the services, products, locations, and other vital features. Mission defines the ongoing
                    current focus and purpose. </p>

                </h1>
                <p>A vision statement is the text mapping of an organization's future and crucial for decision-making
                    procedures. In other words, we can say that the vision guides the alignment of decisions and the
                    company's declared goals. It is the road map that shows the future position of the company</p>

                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>Some people would say that all you need to do is work hard to achieve what you want in life. Some
                    people
                    think it's about who you know or what you have. Yet others feel there are those born with access and
                    that they are given all the breaks in life. The truth is, statistics demonstrate that those who
                    create
                    goals and have a regular and consistent goal-setting process are much more likely to achieve their
                    life’s dreams.</p>

            <p>Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your funders and

                knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation.</p>

            <p>In the past 20 years, Minnesota, much like the rest of the United States, has reflected a global
                community. Refugees and immigrants are coming from all over the world—West and East Africa, Southeast
                Asia, Russia and Bosnia, Central and South America, and the Middle East—and contributing to the economic
                system.</p>
