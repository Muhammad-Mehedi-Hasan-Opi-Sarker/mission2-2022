                <p>A mission statement is all about the current active plans of the organization that defines goals. In
                    other words, it states the purpose of the organization and the reason it has existed. Also, it
                    represents the services, products, locations, and other vital features. Mission defines the ongoing
                    current focus and purpose. </p>

                    procedures. In other words, we can say that the vision guides the alignment of decisions and the

            <p>In the past 20 years, Minnesota, much like the rest of the United States, has reflected a global
                community. Refugees and immigrants are coming from all over the world—West and East Africa, Southeast
                Asia, Russia and Bosnia, Central and South America, and the Middle East—and contributing to the economic
                system.</p>

            <p> Books are my ultimate friend. I like spending time with them. Whether it is a mood to increase knowledge
                or entertainment – they are always available. Read as much as you want, when you want, read whatever you
                want. No limits, limitless topics, unlimited availability. Reading fiction stories, jokes, novels,
                dramas, biographies, travel stories are all interesting and informative to humans. Books are our best
                friends, it never deceives us.

                Books never allow the feeling of loneliness. But a caution about the books is necessary. According to
                our age, we should study only useful books on appropriate subjects.</p>
